## Overview & Strategy

### Cal AI's Formula (Adapted for DayDif)

1. Hook with value proposition
2. Collect personalization data (creates investment)
3. Sprinkle in social proof and value reinforcement screens
4. Build toward a "personalized plan" reveal
5. Request permissions after trust is established
6. Present paywall only after user feels invested

### DayDif Adaptation

Your value prop is transforming "dead commute time" into structured learning. The onboarding should make users visualize their wasted time becoming valuable, then show them a personalized learning plan that feels custom-built.

### Flow Summary

| Phase | Screens | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| Hook & Entry | 1-2 | Brand + value prop |
| Personal Context | 3-9 | Commute, time, interests |
| Goals & Motivation | 10-14 | Why they're here, barriers, pace |
| Trust & Personalization | 15-17 | Emotional beat, schedule, health |
| Social Proof & Permissions | 18-20 | Reviews, notifications, referral |
| Plan Generation | 21-24 | Build anticipation, reveal plan, account |
| Paywall | 25 | Conversion |
| App Entry | 26 | First session |

**Total: 26 screens**

---

## Tone & Voice Guidelines

### Do:

- Be confident and direct
- Use "you" and "your" liberally
- Keep sentences short
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Acknowledge user struggles without dwelling

### Don't:

- Use emojis (per design system)
- Be overly casual or cute
- Make promises you can't keep
- Use jargon or buzzwords
- Sound robotic or corporate

### Voice Examples:

| Instead of | Write |
|------------|-------|
| "Utilize your commute time for educational purposes" | "Turn your commute into your classroom" |
| "Our algorithm will generate personalized content recommendations" | "We'll pick the perfect lessons for you" |
| "You have not yet completed account registration" | "Save your progress" |

---

## Design Implementation Notes

Per the DayDif Design System:

- **No emojis** — use elegant icons instead
- **Progress bar** — thin, minimal, Blinkist green (#00A86B) fill
- **Typography** — use established hierarchy (Heading1 for headlines, Body for subtext)
- **Cards** — use OnboardingChoiceCard component with selection animations
- **Buttons** — primary black, full-width for main CTAs
- **Spacing** — follow token system (lg padding on cards, xl between sections)
- **Animations** — subtle, professional (no bouncy/playful animations)

---

## Psychological Principles Applied

1. **Progressive commitment** — each screen is a small "yes" that builds toward the big "yes" (subscription)

2. **Personalization theater** — collecting data makes users feel the plan is truly custom

3. **Value reinforcement screens** — Screens 6, 12, and 14 pause data collection to remind users why this matters

4. **Barrier acknowledgment** — Screens 11-12 validate struggles and position DayDif as the solution

5. **Social proof placement** — comes late (Screen 18), after users are invested but before final commitments

6. **Plan generation drama** — loading animation creates anticipation and makes the plan feel "built" for them

7. **Account creation after investment** — users don't want to lose their personalized plan

8. **Free trial framing** — "No payment due now" reduces friction at the paywall
